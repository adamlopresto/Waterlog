Waterlog
========

An app to remind me to drink more water. Acts as a dead man's switch until I've
drunk enough for the day, every time I tell it I got another drink, it resets
its timer. If an hour passes without me telling it, it reminds me. Very simple
and not customizable at all, because it's mostly just scratching a personal
itch.
